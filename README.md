#### Intro
One of my friends told me about she can't find mechanics when needed, so I tought about a project for connect customers-mechanics. Started with backend, created entities, created logics about appointments; who can send review? who can create appointments? is he must be verified or not? how mechanics and customers will verify themselves? I tought about this...

Actually I really love coding at backend but mobile development was struggling me. Creating appointments, (Writing Review's)'s mechanics are ready but not implemented in mobile app.
PR's are welcome!
